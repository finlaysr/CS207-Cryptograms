# User Stroies 2 - Gameplay

## Stakeholder : User

* As a user, I want to be able to ask for a hint if i'm stuck as I continue progress with the puzzle and not leave it unsolved.

* As a user, I want to be able to display the full solution to a puzzle as if I am stuck and cannot make any further progress, I want to see where I went wrong.

* As a user, when I correctly decipher a letter I would like the game to autofill all other instances of this letter in the message so as it is more convinient and I don't have to re-type the same letter multiple times.

* As a user, I want to be able to have the option to play a large options of games, so as there is variety in the messages to be decoding and I am not repeating the same messages.

* As a user, I want to be able to change my puzzle if the current one is too difficult, so that I am not stuck and can get another chance to solve a puzzle.

* As a user, I want to have a stopwatch timer from when I first start completing the puzzle so as I can see how first I can solve puzzle.

* As a user, I want to be able to view the rules so as when I'm playing for the first time I know what to do and I am not confused.

* As a user, I want to check the frequency of letters appearing in the message, as this will make it easier to solve the puzzle.
